# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as specified in constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard Python libraries only (no external dependencies)
**Storage**: In-memory only with no persistent storage (as specified in constitution)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration tests
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Console application (single project)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response times for all operations
**Constraints**: <100MB memory usage, <5MB application size, in-memory only storage
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, local application, up to 1000 tasks in memory

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ Spec-Driven Development First: All implementation will follow the spec requirements
- ✅ Simplicity & Clarity: Using minimal, readable code with no unnecessary abstractions
- ✅ In-Memory Data Only: Tasks will exist only in runtime memory, no persistent storage
- ✅ Clean Code Practices: Meaningful names and single responsibility per function
- ✅ User-Friendly Console Experience: Clear prompts and error messages
- ✅ Python Standards: Following PEP8 formatting and Python 3.13+ standards
- ✅ Modularity: Business logic separated from user I/O

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
