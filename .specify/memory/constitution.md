# In-Memory Todo Console Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development First
All features must be implemented strictly according to approved specifications. No functionality should be added without a corresponding spec.

### II. Simplicity & Clarity
Code should be readable, minimal, and beginner-friendly. Avoid unnecessary abstractions or frameworks.

### III. In-Memory Data Only
Tasks must exist only during runtime. No database, file storage, or external persistence is allowed.

### IV. Clean Code Practices
Meaningful variable and function names. Single responsibility for each function. Clear separation of concerns.

### V. User-Friendly Console Experience
Clear prompts and messages. Consistent formatting of output. Helpful error messages.

### VI. Python Standards
Python version: 3.13+. Follow PEP8 formatting and conventions.

### VII. Modularity
Business logic must be separated from user input/output. Code must be structured under a /src directory.

## Non-Goals
- No GUI or web interface.
- No authentication or user accounts.
- No data persistence beyond runtime.

## Definition of Done
- All five basic Todo features are implemented.
- Application runs successfully from terminal.
- Code follows the approved specs.
- Repository contains required documentation and spec history.

## Governance
This constitution governs all development decisions for the project. Any changes to these principles require formal amendment procedures. All code must comply with these principles. Code reviews will verify adherence to these principles.
